The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
went wrong.



Solution as below
1. Connect to secondary via ssh
2. Check the process of RabbitMQ

ps -ef | grep rabbitmq

3. Kill the progress

ps -ef | grep rabbitmq | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

4.Start the RabbitMQ server

rabbitmq-server

5. Run rabbitmqctl status successfully
